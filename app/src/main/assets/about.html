    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Ostatic is a way to easily browse classic video games OSTs</p>
    <p>This app is just a proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates an interface similar to spotify with data collected
        from <a href="http://downloads.khinsider.com">KHinsider downloads</a>. For being a POC it is very unstable and
        might present some crashes or unintended behaviours</p>
    <p>All albums and songs are cached in a local database and the songs are streamed from KHinsider website. You can
        only listen to and search songs that are in this local database. You cannot search the whole KHinsder library,
        that has more than 500.000 songs. This was made to add more details to the UI (like the albums thumbnails)</p>

    <h1>Next steps</h1>
    <p>More features are planned to be added to this app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Media controls inside app (shuffle, repeat, next, previous, etc) - basic for any media app</li>
        <li>Favorite songs and albums. You would access them in a "Library" tab</li>
        <li>Random songs playlist or random album. A way to discover new songs and albums from games that you never
            heard
        </li>
        <li>Download songs and albums. You would be able to download songs and whole albums to listem to them offline
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some features (like downloading songs) will require premission from the admins of KHinsider, since they charge to
        do massive downloads from their website. Only time will tell if these features could be added without too much
        trouble.</p>

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
